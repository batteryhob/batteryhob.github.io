## Introduction: The Age of AI Sovereignty

As of 2025, the world has entered fierce competition to secure **Sovereign AI**. As US-centered hyper-scale AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini dominate the global market, governments worldwide are beginning to realize the risks of technological dependency.

Korea is also pursuing an ambitious national project to develop an **independent foundation model** amid this trend. This is not simply about "let's build AI too," but a strategic choice for **national security, economic autonomy, and future industrial leadership**.

This article examines what vision Korea's Sovereign AI project has, how far it has progressed, and what significance it holds in the global AI landscape.

## Why Sovereign AI? The Risks of Technological Dependency

### 1. Data Sovereignty and Security

Using US-based AI services means **national core data is transmitted to foreign servers**.
